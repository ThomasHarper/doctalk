# doctalk : speak english plz

Doctalk is a bot that hears people talking in a channel and detects the language they are speaking.
If they don't speak the language(s) wanted, Doctalk will ask them to speak the desired language.

doctalk is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku].

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality is
available, etc!

### Running doctalk Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start doctalk locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    doctalk>

Then you can interact with doctalk by typing `doctalk help`.

    doctalk> doctalk help
    doctalk animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    doctalk help - Displays all of the help commands that doctalk knows about.
    ...

### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide][scripting-docs].

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

## Deployment

    % git push heroku master


## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if
you're having issues.
